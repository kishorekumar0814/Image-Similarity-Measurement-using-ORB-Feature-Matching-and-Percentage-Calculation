# Image-Similarity-Measurement-using-ORB-Feature-Matching-and-Percentage-Calculation
The objective of this project is to develop a system that compares two images and determines their similarity as a percentage. This is achieved by using feature extraction and matching techniques to identify common visual elements between the images.
